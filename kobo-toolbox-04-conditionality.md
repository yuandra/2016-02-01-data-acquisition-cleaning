### Conditionality in Kobo Toolbox

Conditionality in Kobo Toolbox is implemented using skip logic.
This means that a question can check the answer of the previous question, and if it fulfill a certain criteria, the question will / or not be shown to the people.

Let's try this out. Let us say that we want the form to be filled by people above 18 year old.

- make a question "what is your age" and set it as text
- put the question what is your age at the beginning
- group all the other question together
- go to question setting (the gear sign in top right of the question), and choose skip logic
- set the question t    o be shown if the answer for the question what is your age is > 18

###Exercise

Make a consent form !

Create a new question asking if you give consent and only show the question if they give consent and their age is > 18
