### Adding a question

Google forms has many question types

- Text: Respondents provide short answers
- Paragraph text: Respondents provide longer answers
- Multiple choice: Respondents select one option from among several
- Checkboxes: Respondents select as many options as they'd like
- Choose from a list: Respondents select one option from a dropdown menu
- Scale: Respondents rank something along a scale of numbers (e.g., from 1 to 5)
- Grid: Respondents select a point from a two-dimensional grid
- Date: Respondents use a calendar picker to enter a date
- Time: Respondents select a time (either a time of day or a duration of time)

First, let us change the form header

- click on the form title area
- change it to "What do you like to drink ?"

Second, let's change the question to ask for our age

- click on the question that Google Form has put inside the form
- change the title to be "what is your age ?"
- change the question type to be "text"

It should like this :
